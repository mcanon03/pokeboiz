- get pokemon by generation:
  - create 3 separate components:
    - gen drop down (parent)
    - type drop down (child)
    - displayed cards (child)

 -- make all the API calls at the beginning
  - gen and pokemon and type
  -  getting individual pokemon info is still it's own separate API calls
  
BUGS:
- routing
  - select type, refresh page --> query remains, but all pokemon are returned

- add empty state if no pokemon


- filter types by generation (?)
  - if nothing present, add text
  - add default image

- add tests



FUTURE:
- add ability to select multiple types
  - update button/checkbox component
- add PWA

END GOAL:
- pokedex by generation
- pokemon guessing game
  - guess name
  - guess type
  - guess weakness (?)
  - guess sound
